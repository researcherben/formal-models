# About 

This repo provides a Dockerfile for Gryphon, the server (and Qt GUI) that provides MONTEREY PHOENIX. 

# Requirements

The software dependencies are in a Dockerfile, so that makes installation and use easier.
However, because the GUI uses QT, if you're on Mac or Windows you'll need to have X11 enabled.
On Mac I'm running [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/).
